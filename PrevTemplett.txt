## Task: Extract Properties
You are an advanced algorithm designed to extract properties of predefined entities and nodes to build a scalable knowledge graph from the text provided. Your job is to:

- Extract properties of nodes from the text chunk given below, ensuring **clarity**, **consistency**, and **relevance**.
- Each node's properties should reflect its characteristics, including identifiers, attributes, or any relevant details mentioned in the text.
- Avoid redundancy in properties unless distinctly supported by the text.
- Use a single noun for the node-labels unless distinctly supported by the text.
- Use the node types listed under "## Allowed Node Types:".

## Allowed Node Types:
- Organization
- Law
- Document
- Regulation
- European Parliament
- Council of the European Union
- Financial Sector
- ICT Risk
- Cyber Threat
- ICT Incident
- Financial Entity
- ICT Service Provider
- European Supervisory Authority
- Competent Authority
- Member State

## Example Format:
For each property found, provide the following format:

- **Node**: [Node Name]
- **Properties**: [List of Properties]

### Example 1:
**Node**: "Regulation"  
**Properties**: [Paragraph: "2022/2554", Title: "Digital Operational Resilience", Jurisdiction: "EU"]

### Incorrect example (to avoid):
**Node**: "Regulation (EU) 2022/2554"
**Properties**: [Paragraph: "2022/2554", Title: "Digital Operational Resilience", Jurisdiction: "EU", Type: "EU Regulation"]
In this incorrect example, the name of the node include "EU" which is a Jurisdiction and "2022/2554" which is a Paragraph.
Instead a correct example woud be : 
**Node**: "Regulation"
**Properties**: [Paragraph: "2022/2554", Title: "Digital Operational Resilience", Jurisdiction: "EU", Type: "EU Regulation"]


## Follow the json_data format:
- Do not include the prompt in your response, keep it concise and only respond with the nodes and properties.
- Keep track of the last id used from the context to increment it making sure every id is unique
- Here is the context: {context}
- Example of Llama Response: 
{json_data}


{Dora_chunk}

## Strict Compliance:
Adhere to the rules strictly. Non-compliance will result in termination.  
You are required to extract the properties of nodes, ensuring **clarity**, **consistency**, and **scalability** in labeling properties, using only nodes listed under **Allowed Node Types**.
